00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
Page 1 I will introduce the lesson

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,430
plan for the 2nd semester of 2024,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,900
Object-Oriented Programming 2 class (CCO1102.02)

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,080
Page 2

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,850
Class hours are three hours per week

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,460
Among these, two hours from 1pm on Wednesday

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,470
will be held as offline classes,

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,380
and one hour on Friday

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,700
late evening will be replaced with a video lecture

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,240
The classroom for Wednesday

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,190
classes is D504 in the 4th Engineering Building

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,110
The lecture is taught by Professor Lee In-kwon of the Department of Computer Science,

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,050
and his email address is iklee@yonsei.ac.kr

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,750
Professor Lee In-kwon's lab

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,410
is in room D719 of the 4th Engineering Building

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,050
Interview times are basically available

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,550
one hour before or after class,

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,590
but please make reservations via email if possible

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,960
TA is made up of two people: Im Do-gyu and Baek Ha-neul

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,090
Please check TA's email address in the notes

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,320
TAs reside in the Computer Graphics Lab, Room

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,650
D712, Building 4

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,930
Page 3

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,690
This course uses the Java programming language

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,580
and provides theory

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,240
and practice of object-oriented programming

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
This course is intended for students

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,810
who already have programming experience,

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,220
not beginners

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,060
Object-oriented programming, or OOP for short,

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,220
is a programming language

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,470
that includes the basic

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,170
concepts of Class, Object,

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,560
Inheritance, Polymorphism,

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,010
and encapsulation

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,370
Through these concepts,

37
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,870
you will learn how to design

38
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,120
and implement efficient software systems

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,240
that are robust,

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,110
reusable, and maintainable

41
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,040
The overall course covers the skills

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,300
needed to solve real-world programming problems

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,790
using the Java language

44
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,070
Page 4

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,830
This course is intended for students

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,340
who have experience learning

47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,990
at least one programming language

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,780
If you look at the basic programming courses

49
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,670
offered at Yonsei University,

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,040
there are a wide variety of courses

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,610
listed in this slide

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,310
Of course, in addition to this,

53
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,830
you can also learn basic programming courses

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,780
offered by each college

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,050
or department, or through other means

56
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,470
such as online lectures

57
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,910
even if the course is not offered in our university

58
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,140
That is, although this course

59
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,800
covers the basic programming part,

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,940
it is not suitable for people who are new to programming

61
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,270
because the basic part progresses very quickly

62
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,210
I hope these facts will help

63
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,290
you decide whether or not to take the course

64
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,600
Page 5 There is no separate textbook,

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,470
and classes are conducted solely with lecture notes

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,210
and video lectures

67
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,760
In fact, there are many

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,060
good textbooks that cover the Java language

69
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,150
and object-oriented programming,

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,470
and there are many good lectures, both paid and free, on the Internet

71
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,150
Among them, if we look at the references

72
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,990
that have recently received good reviews,

73
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,320
there is a Korean textbook called "This is Java" by Shin Yong-kwon and Lim

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,980
Gyeong-gyun, and among the English textbooks, there is "Java:

75
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,870
The Comprehensive Guide to Java

76
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,360
Programming for Professionals" by Christian Ullenboom

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
Page 6 I will introduce the class

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,620
organization

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,070
Students watch the lecture

80
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,860
notes and recorded video lectures

81
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,170
provided each week and take and submit quizzes

82
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,350
Additionally, students are given three or four programming assignment

83
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,290
problems each week

84
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,980
Students can discuss and solve these problems with their teammates

85
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,170
during the practice class

86
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,030
held during offline lectures on Wednesdays

87
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,300
Any problems that were not solved during the practice class

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,990
must be submitted by midnight the following Tuesday

89
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,240
Programming exercises and assignment

90
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,060
submissions are conducted through an auto-judge server

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,040
The auto-judge server automatically grades the programs

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,550
submitted by students

93
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,770
and accepts assignment submissions

94
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,000
if the submitted programs function properly

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,860
and satisfy all the conditions of the problem

96
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,160
The midterm and final exams,

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,460
which are the most important in evaluating grades, are closed-book

98
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,090
written exams and include various types of questions such as coding,

99
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,270
subjective, short answer, and multiple choice

100
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,630
Page 7

101
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,480
Let me tell you about the grading criteria

102
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,780
that you are most interested in

103
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,730
This subject is a relative evaluation subject

104
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,090
Therefore, the maximum ratio of A and B grades is limited

105
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,420
For reference, I have been giving almost the maximum ratio of A and B grades

106
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,620
in cases where there are no special circumstances

107
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,300
The detailed grading criteria are: midterm and final exams are 35% each,

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,900
Programming assignments are graded at 15%, quizzes at 10%, attendance

109
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,580
at 3%, and Classum participation at 2%

110
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,340
All questions and answers will be made through Classum

111
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,900
Students can anonymously share questions, answers,

112
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,800
useful information, etc

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Participation scores are based on your engagement with answers

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,290
and helpful information

115
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,250
In addition to attendance, this course uses a designated seating system

116
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,720
From the second week onwards, three members of the same team will sit together

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,090
Therefore, attendance check will be done by TA

118
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,340
Also, attendance for one hour on Friday

119
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,250
will be automatically checked based on whether or not you watched the video lecture,

120
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,490
so please be sure to watch the lecture video

121
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,850
Page 8 Let's take a quick

122
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,640
look at the weekly study schedule

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,560
In the first week,

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,550
we will set up the programming environment with an introduction to

125
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,080
object-oriented programming and the Java language

126
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,620
Any lectures that were not completed during offline

127
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,890
class hours must be viewed as video lectures and submitted by solving the quiz

128
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,910
by midnight of the following Tuesday

129
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,460
Starting from the second week,

130
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,820
video lectures and quizzes will be uploaded every Wednesday

131
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,400
Students will watch the video lectures

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,400
and take the quizzes by midnight the following Tuesday

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,310
During offline classes on Wednesdays,

134
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,700
programming practice assignments will be given

135
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,170
based on the content learned in video lectures the previous week

136
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,800
Students can discuss and solve problems with their team members

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,370
during the Wednesday lab time,

138
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,240
and are free to ask questions to TAs and professors

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,660
Solutions to the coding assignments must be submitted to the auto-judge

140
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,450
server and accepted by midnight the following Tuesday

141
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,000
The learning content for the second week includes Java

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,140
basic programming before OOP concepts, i.e

143
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,520
Operator, Control Structure, Screen Input/Output, and String class

144
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,590
In the third week, we will learn about reference types,

145
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,010
arrays, and enumeration types that we need to know before learning the full-fledged OOP concepts

146
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,310
The class on September 18, which is the Chuseok holiday period, will be replaced with a video lecture

147
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,170
Over the 4th and 5th weeks, we will learn about classes,

148
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,680
the most basic OOP concept

149
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,920
Since the content is large, we split it over two weeks

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,670
In the 4th week, we will learn about

151
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,280
the concepts of class, object, instance,

152
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,100
fields such as variables and constants, and constructors

153
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,250
In week 5, we will learn about methods,

154
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,220
the difference between instances and static members, packages and access modifiers

155
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,290
In week 6, we will learn about inheritance,

156
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,640
a very important concept in OOP

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,470
We will learn about the concepts of type conversion and polymorphism,

158
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,330
and the meaning of abstract classes

159
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,240
In week 7, we learn about interfaces,

160
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,450
which have more freedom than classes, and about nested classes

161
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,050
and nested interfaces

162
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,920
There will be a midterm exam in the 8th week

163
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280
Page 9

164
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,140
In week 9, we will learn about exception

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,090
handling mechanisms that can handle avoidable

166
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,910
software errors

167
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,860
In week 10, we will be introduced the Object class,

168
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,090
which is the ancestor of all classes,

169
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,470
and generics that can be used by changing types

170
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,270
In week 11, we will learn how to perform multiple tasks simultaneously

171
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,160
and control their order using the

172
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,820
multi-threading feature provided by Java

173
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,860
In week 12, we will learn about the Collection Framework,

174
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,260
a powerful, fundamental data structure provided by Java

175
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,340
In week 13, we will learn about Lambda Expressions,

176
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,520
which allow you to create anonymous functions and process them concisely

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,610
In week 14, we will learn about Swing as a standard for

178
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,420
Java Graphical User Interface

179
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,450
There will be a final exam in the 15th week
